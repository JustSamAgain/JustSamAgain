## Hi there üëã

I'm JustSamAgain and I love IT(-Security) and electrical engineering.

Currently I'm studying computer science at University and have since implemented a few projects, for which some of my friends have already labeled me a nerd. ^^

My latest ones are:
- ‚å®Ô∏è custom split keyboard with custom layout (repo will be online in a few days)
- a small motion alert system with an esp32 (should also be public in a few days)
- CL [GaussSimulator](https://github.com/JustSamAgain/GaussSimualtor) for visualizing the progress when working with matrices

Currently I'm working on/interested in:
- getting used to my custom split keyboard layout
- the [VESC motor control firmware](https://github.com/vedderb/bldc)
- setting up my own media-server

Funniest repos you should have seen:
- [open-and-shut](https://github.com/veggiedefender/open-and-shut)
- [GulfOfMexico](https://github.com/TodePond/GulfOfMexico/tree/main)
