## Hi there üëã

I'm JustSamAgain and I love IT(-Security) and electrical engineering.

Currently I'm studying computer science at University and have since implemented a few projects, for which some of my friends have already labeled me a nerd. ^^

My latest ones are:
- ‚å®Ô∏è [custom split keyboard with custom layout](https://github.com/JustSamAgain/rae-dux-guide-and-config)
- a small motion alert system with an esp32 (should also be public someday)
- CL [GaussSimulator](https://github.com/JustSamAgain/GaussSimualtor) for visualizing the progress when working with matrices

Currently I'm working on/interested in:
- getting used to my custom split keyboard layout
- the [VESC motor control firmware](https://github.com/vedderb/bldc)
- setting up my own media-server

Realllyy good sources to learn from:
- [Introduction to a Self Managed Life by Louis Rossmann](https://wiki.futo.org/wiki/Introduction_to_a_Self_Managed_Life:_a_13_hour_%26_28_minute_presentation_by_FUTO_software)
- [Make it yourself - 1000 Useful Things to Make](https://makeityourself.org/)

Funniest repos you should have seen:
- [open-and-shut](https://github.com/veggiedefender/open-and-shut)
- [GulfOfMexico](https://github.com/TodePond/GulfOfMexico/tree/main)
